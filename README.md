Here is the game, make sure you have both images installed. It won't work without. Once the program is started it's a two player ultimate tick-tac-toe game.
You can only choose in the green box. Whichever box you choose will send your opponent to the big box in the same position. The first person to get three big boxes
in a row wins.
